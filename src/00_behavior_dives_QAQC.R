########## DETAILS OF BEHAVIOR CSV

#- DeployID Friendly (and should be unique) name given to the tag by the user. If no specific friendly name is given, this is the PTT ID.

#- PTT Argos Platform Transmitter Terminal identifier, which is a unique number identifying your instrument.

#- DepthSensor Indicates the resolution of the depth sensor. Typical values are 0.1m, 0.5, and 1.0m. 
#             The value in this column is blank if the gain was unavailable - in this case a 0.5-meter resolution is assumed.

#- Source Indicates where the data came from, or how it was generated.

#- Instr Wildlife Computers instrument family.

#- Count Total number of times this particular data item was received, verified, and successfully
# decoded.

#- Start Timestamp when the particular behavior item began, to the nearest 30 seconds.

#- End Timestamp when the particular behavior item ended.

#- What Kind of element - Surface, Haulout, Dive, Message, or Unrecognized.

#- Number The number of times the behavior element described by the following Shape, Depth,
# and Duration columns occurred back-to-back.

#- Shape If the behavior is a dive, this is the shape of the dive determined by the tag (see below).

#- DepthMin The dive Depth is between DepthMin and DepthMax meters.

#- DepthMax The dive Depth is between DepthMin and DepthMax meters.

#- DurationMin The duration of the element is between DurationMin and DurationMax seconds.

#- DurationMax The duration of the element is between DurationMin and DurationMax seconds.

################################## THESE ARE RELICS I BELIEVE
#- Shallow In between dives, this is the spent ABOVE the threshold to determine start and end of a
# dive.

#- Deep In between dives, this is the time spent BELOW the threshold to determine start and
# end of a time and ABOVE the depth required to qualify a dive.

# NOTES ABOUT ADL and POTENTIAL DIVE DATA ALIASING DUE TO 10Sec sampling interval for our juvenile gray seals.

# FOR ALL DIVES: plot IDI vs Duration - if 100% of these don't make sense... likely some depth aliasing. Meaning
# if the animal isn't spending time at the surfacing recovering from a 30 min dive, it likely isn't real.
# Vertical ascent / decent rate can be > 1m/s thus the animal could surface
# (5 m to sea level, quick breath, and go back down in <10 seconds) resulting in dive aliasing (two different dives getting concatenated)

########################### DEFINITIONS and BACKGROUND ######################################################
# ADL: the point during a dive when lactic acid begins to increase above resting levels, i.e. the threshold where the animal goes from exclusively oxidative metabolism to including anaerobic metabolism (Costa et al., 2023)

#Beyond this ???threshold,??? a substantial increase in the post-dive surface interval
# is required to clear the lactate acid to restore it to pre-dive levels. 
# Unfortunately, the ADL has only been directly measured in a few species because of logistical challenges: 
# Weddell seals (Kooyman et al., 1980)
# Baikal seals (Pusa sibirica) (Ponganis et al., 1997a)
# California sea lions (Ponganis et al., 1997c), 
# emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) (Ponganis et al., 1997b), 
# beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) (Shaffer et al., 1996) and bottlenose dolphins (Williams et al., 1999).

# When animals dive aerobically (below the ADL), the post-dive surface interval is short relative to the dive duration.
# However, when they exceed the ADL, the post-dive surface interval 
# (or recovery time) becomes a more significant proportion of the dive cycle. 
# Thus, an animal spends more time at the surface recovering from a dive than underwater in a dive, 
# reducing its overall efficiency. 
# This led to the concept that animals should dive aerobically for routine sustained diving, 
# reserving anaerobic dives for rare or extreme events (Kooyman et al., 1980).


# Noren et al. 2005 
# -CADL (calculated/estimated by dividing usable oxygen stores (measured) by the estimated rate of O2 consumption) 
# reports in the literature:
# Aerobic dive limit for western Atlantic adult gray seals: 11.9 +/- 0.9 minutes
# cADL Yearling: 6.1 +/- 0.3 minutes
# 24 Days Post Weaning: 3.8 +/- 0.1 minutes

# Personal Comms.
# err on the side of a time-dependant threshold informed by 2024 higher resolution data. 
# longest 2024 dive is 8 mins 35 seconds - 
# anything beyond 10 mins and definitely 12 mins, should be treated with caution. 
# as a field ecological contextualization of diving physiology 
# is so poor that we're just not there yet in terms of getting a more physiologically-informed 
# basis for what might be an ADL cut-off would be, or what that actually means for the animal during repeated diving. 

# Beck et al. 2003 dive behavior sable island grays

# 90 - 92% of dives < 8 minutes duration
# Maximum durations were 20.3 minutes (M) and 22.0 min (F)

# 95-97% of dives < 120m depth
# Max dive depth was 412 for M and 354 F

#Jessopp et al. 2013 
# Max dive depth in eastern Atlantic grays: 455m
